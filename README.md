# Predicting the Billboard 100
## with Machine Learning, Spotify and Genius data
Popular music makes money, plain and simple. Knowing the nature of popular music is important if you're in the business of scouting for musical talent or producing albums... and also if you're composing indie music, lest your tunes sound derivative.

## The Goal
Make a predictive ML model to predict whether a track will be on the Billboard 100, beat the score (88% accuracy) of this [2019 University-San Francisco Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.08609), and make inferences about the nature of popular music. 

## The Data
I gathered Billboard data for about 7,000 tracks that were on the Hot 100 within the years 2000-2019 inclusive. From there, I gathered Spotify and Genius data for those 7,000 tracks plus all other tracks that were on the same albums (another ~43,000, bringing the total to ~50,000 tracks).
