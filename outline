=== Intro ===
Motivation: size of the music industry
past work - working with the MSD



=== Gathering Data ===
Title/Ablum name mismatch
release year mismatch?

=== Predictions ===
Models:
-Random Forest
-XGBoost
-Logistic Regression
Data Transformations:
-sentiment from text
-dummyizing columns:
--album type
--numeric types like key and time_signature
--record label
-track placement

can drop album_type, time_signature, and mode, and all the dummies and those will actually make the model more accurate by reducing the complexity.

can also drop key and explicit without significant losses to accuracy (1 or 2 tenths of a percent each time)

=== Inferences ===
Values of each feature
Hit Song placement in albums
Label Hit distribution
Increase of Indie labels? around turn of the last decade?
Track Placement

=== Future Work ===
NLP
